![](Images/japaneseCurry.jpeg)

#### Serves 3 - 35 mins

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 5 spring onions

- Finely sliced small bunch of coriander

- 3 cloves garlic

- Finely chopped 3cm fresh ginger

- 1 large potato, peeled and cut into 1.5cm cubes

- 1 large carrot, cut into 1cm cubes

- 8 boneless and skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3cm chunks

- 1 heaped tbsp curry powder

- 1 tsp mild chilli powder

- 1 tbsp soy sauce

- 1 tbsp plain flour

- 300ml chicken stock (one cube)

- rice, to serve

#### Directions

Put the oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. When it is hot, add the spring onions and half of the coriander, garlic, ginger, potato and carrot. Stir-fry for 2 minutes.

Slide in all of the chopped chicken and fry for a further minute. Reduce the heat a little, sprinkle in both the curry powder and the chilli powder and continue to fry, stirring almost constantly for 1 minute. Drop in the flour and continue to stir-fry for a further 30 seconds before pouring in the stock and soy sauce.

Increase the heat and while stirring very regularly, bring the mixture up to the boil. Lower to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, until the potato and carrots are cooked through, while still holding their shape, and the chicken thigh pieces are fully cooked. Top the curry with the remaining coriander leaves and serve with rice.

## Salmon Teriyaki Noodles

![](Images/2022-07-10-11-16-29-image.png)

#### Serves 2 - 20 mins

**Teriyaki Sauce**

- 2 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 2 tbsp cooking sake, or Chinese cooking wine
- 1 tsp white sugar

**Other**

- 1 tbsp oil (veg or canola)
- 250g salmon fillet(s), skinless, sliced into 2cm wide pieces down their length
- 2 instant noodle / ramen noodle cakes (discard seasoning packs) (Note 2 other noodles)
- 1 onion , cut into quarters and sliced
- 2 garlic clove , finely minced
- 1 small bunch Chinese of stem greens like tenderstem broccoli cut in half lengthways

#### Directions

- Mix the Teriyaki sauce and coat salmon with 1 tablespoon of it in a bowl, then set aside while you cook the noodles.

- Cook the noodles as per the packet directions but without the seasoning sachet, then set aside.

- Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large **non-stick** pan over high heat. Cook the salmon for 1 - 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden, then remove to a plate. Pour any remaining sauce in the skillet over the salmon.

- Heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil on medium and cook the onion and garlic for 30 seconds. Add the stem greens and cook for 1 minute.

- Add noodles and half the sauce. Toss for 2 minutes until the Sauce is absorbed. Add the remaining sauce and toss to disperse. Then spread the noodles out in the pan, cook for 30 seconds un-disturbed. Repeat again 3 to 4 times (~3 min total) – a trick for nice caramelisation on the noodles (which = flavour!).

#### Serves 2 - 30 mins

- 1 pack unsmoked streaky bacon, sliced into 2cm strips

- 1 cabbage (savoy / hakusai), halved, core removed, chopped lengthways, and then chopped across into squares. Make sure all the chunks are broken up.

- 1 bunch of spring onions, green part cut into 4cm segments, white part finely sliced

- 2 tsp (4 cloves) garlic, minced

- 1 tsp ginger paste

- 1 tsp chilli paste

- 2 tbsp cooking sake

- 400g straight to wok noodles

**Sauce**

- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce

- 1 tbsp oyster sauce

- 1 tbsp ketchup

- 1 tbsp sake

- 1 tbsp lea and perins

- 1 tsp sugar

#### Directions

1. Slice the bacon and put it in a cold non-stick pan on medium high heat, grind a good amount of pepper all over it.

2. While the bacon is frying, chop the cabbage and spring onions, and put the garlic, ginger paste, and chilli paste into a small dish.

3. Once the bacon has good colour (not full crispy though), still on medium high add the cabbage, spring onion, and the paste mix and fry for a few mins until the cabbage wilts a bit, mixing regularly. While waiting, mix everything in the sauce into a small bowl. Once the veg has wilted a bit, add the sake and mix in for 20 secs to burn off the alcohol, then put everything aside onto a plate.

4. Put the pan back on the heat (still medium high) with 1-2 tbsp of oil, and add the noodles, swirling them around to coat in oil. Keep frying on one side until they go partially golden brown (this is key), then flip them and fry the other side. Once fried, separate the noodles, add the bacon and veg mixture back, mix together, then add the sauce mixture, stirring for 30 secs to reduce it a bit. Serve.
