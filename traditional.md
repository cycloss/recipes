## Coq au Stock

![](Images/coqAuStock.jpeg)

#### Serves 2 - 1 hr

- Knob of butter

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 6 chicken leg portions, bone-in and skin-on

- onion, diced

- 6 rashers of streaky bacon, cut into 1cm slices

- 4 cloves garlic, chopped

- 200g mushrooms, roughly chopped

- salt and pepper

- 250ml chicken stock (1 cube)

- 175g green beans, trimmed

- 100g crème fraiche

- To serve ½ bunch of chives, finely chopped

- Mashed potato

#### Directions

Melt the butter and oil in a very large frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the butter is bubbling, lay the chicken portions into the pan to brown, skin-side down. Aim for a deep golden brown all over - this should take about 8 minutes. When the legs are brown, transfer them onto a plate.

Scrape the chopped onion and bacon slices into the pan and fry over a medium to high heat for about 4 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften. Add the garlic and mushrooms along with a good pinch of salt and pepper and continue stir-frying for a further 2 minutes.

Lay the chicken pieces back into the pan, skin-side down, and pour in the chicken stock. Crank up the heat and bring the liquid to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Place a lid on top and leave the chicken to cook for 25 minutes.

After 20 minutes, carefully remove the lid and scatter the green beans over the top, then place the lid back on and cook for a further 5 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked.

Stir in the crème fraiche and bring the sauce to the boil one last time. Scatter with the chopped chives and serve.

## Chicken Pie

![](Images/2022-02-01-10-38-58-image.png)

#### Serves 4

- 2 large knobs of butter

- 1 large leek, washed and chopped into 2cm pieces

- 200g mushrooms, roughly chopped

- 4 x 250g chicken breast fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces

- 250ml chicken stock (1 cube)

- 1 tbsp cornflour

- 100ml double cream

- 2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves

- About 6 sheets of filo pastry

- Drizzle of olive oil

- Peas, salad, and/or mash to serve
1. Preheat your oven to 190°C (fan 170°C). Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the leek and mushrooms and fry for 2–3 minutes until they just start to soften. Crank up the heat to high, add the chicken pieces and fry for a further 2 minutes – the chicken won’t be cooked through at this point – then pour in the chicken stock and let it come to a simmer.

2. Meanwhile, mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water until smooth, then pour into the pan, along with the cream. Bring back to the boil, stirring gently, and cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach, then tip the whole lot into a pie dish about 28cm x 15cm. Set aside to cool a little.

3. Take a sheet of filo and roughly crumple it in your hands – there is no right or wrong to this method! Place the crumpled filo on top of the chicken filling in the pie dish and repeat with the remaining filo sheets.

4. Drizzle the pastry with olive oil, then bake the pie for about 20 minutes, by which time the filo will have crisped up and turned golden brown in places. Serve up your pie with fresh salad or some vegetables.

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (fan 170°C, gas mark 5).  Add oil to large pan or casserole dish over a high heat. Add the meat to the pan, brown it all over.

2. Dollop the butter into the same pan and melt it over a medium to high heat. When bubbling, add the onion, celery, carrot and mushrooms and fry, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Drop in the thyme and bay leaf and continue to fry for another minute.  

3. Squeeze in the tomato puree. Stir-fry for 1 minute and then pour in the Worcestershire sauce and stock. Bring to a gentle simmer.  

4. Mix the cornflour with 1 tablespoon of water and then stir it into the beef mixture. It should thicken pretty quickly. Transfer to a baking dish and leave to cool for 10 minutes.  

5. Take the filo pastry out of the fridge, crumple the individual sheets into loose balls and place straight on top of the cooling stew so that it is entirely covered.  

6. Drizzle the pastry with olive oil and then bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is browned and crisp. Serve with mounds of steamed green veg.

## Creamy Dijon Chicken

![](Images/2022-05-20-10-00-56-image.png)

#### Serves 4 - 45 mins

**The Chicken**

- ~500g boneless, skinless chicken thigh or breast cut into slices about the size of one mouthful
- Salt & Pepper
- 150g bacon (diced)

**The Sauce**

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley (optional)
- 1 teaspoon each of thyme and rosemary (be generous)
- 100ml dry white wine (Pinot Grigio/Gris, Sauv Blanc, Riesling)
- 350ml double cream
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 100g grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 good handfuls of baby spinach leaves

**To Serve**

- Greens

- Mash

#### Directions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over high heat, add the chicken, season it with a pinch of salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper, and cook until browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer to a plate; set aside.

2. To the same pan or skillet, reduce heat to medium-high (prevents fond from burning), and add the bacon, frying until crispy. Transfer to plate, set aside. At this point there should be a good layer of brown fond on the bottom of the pan.

3. Reduce heat to medium. Heat butter in the pan and sauté onion until transparent. Sauté garlic, thyme, and rosemary for about 1 minute until fragrant.

4. Add in the white wine to deglaze the pan while scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan. Also add the stock cube. Simmer for ~2 minutes or until wine has reduced by half.

5. Reduce heat to medium low, important as the cream will split if boiled. Pour in the Dijon mustard first to cool down the mixture, then add the cream, and mix through heating gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken.

6. Add the Parmesan and half of the bacon (all if you can't be bothered with it as a topping), and allow to melt through the sauce. Season with a generous amount of pepper.

7. Add the spinach and allow to wilt. Return chicken to the skillet and reheat. Add some water if too thick.

8. Top with the crispy bacon if you didn't add all of it already. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.

## Shepherds / Cottage Pie

![](Images/2022-08-31-10-33-31-image.png)

#### Serves 5 - 1.5 hrs

**Mince**

- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1 celery stick, finely chopped
- 3/4 tsp each dried thyme and rosemary (or 2 sprigs fresh thyme + 1 sprig rosemary)
- 750g minced lamb (shepherds) OR beef (cottage)
- 1/4 cup (35g) flour , plain/all purpose
- 1/4 cup (55g) tomato paste
- 2 cups (500ml) beef stock (**3** cubes)
- 1/2 cup (125ml) red wine (or water)
- 1.5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- Salt, pepper, and sriracha (optional)
- 1 cup frozen peas

**Mash**

- 1 kg potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 2/3 cup (165 ml) milk (whole or low fat)
- 2 tbsp (30g) butter

**Crust**

- 2 – 3 tbsp grated parmesan , optional
- Chopped chives to garnish

#### Directions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots, celery, thyme and rosemary. Cook for 3 minutes or until softened and sweet.
2. Turn heat up to high. Add lamb/beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until browned.
3. Add flour and mix in. Add tomato paste, stock, red wine, Worcestershire sauce and bay leaves. Bring to simmer, then turn down heat so it is simmering rapidly - I have it on medium. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces down to a thick gravy consistency.
4. Once the mince is simmering, put water on to boil, chop the potatoes. When the water is boiling preheat oven to 180C/350F and and then cook the potatoes in boiling water for 15-20 minutes or until soft. Drain then return to pot on turned off stove. Allow to steam dry for 30 seconds or so (prevents it making the mince watery). Add butter, milk, and salt, and mash until a spreadable consistency.
5. When mince has finished simmering, adjust salt and pepper to taste (add a small amount of sriracha for an almost undetectable hum), then transfer to 1.5 litre baking dish (could try doing it in the pan the mince is currently in if it is large). Stir through peas.
6. Spread mash onto pie, use a fork to draw squiggles over the surface. Sprinkle with parmesan.
7. Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until deep golden on top and bubbling on the edges. Stick a knife into the middle to ensure it is piping hot. Garnished with chives if desired and serve.

## Swedish Meatballs

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 21.24.19.jpg](Images/0b9a42615cf1f1bf01a20b78459151374e6ebf85.jpg)

#### Serves 4 - 1 hr

- 2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed, chopped into small 2cm cubes
- 1 brown onion, grated (removes the need to fry the onion to soften it)
- 300g beef mince
- 300g pork mince
- 1 egg
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp All Spice powder
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp oil

**Gravy**

- 40g / 3 tbsp butter , unsalted
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 cups beef stock
- 1/2 cup double cream
- 2 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp dijon mustard? (from ikea recipe)

**Serve with**

- Lingonberry / cranberry jam

- Mash and greens

#### Directions

1. Grate the onion using a standard box grater, scrape onion and juices into bowl. Chop and then add the bread and mix well – onion juice should make bread soggy (if not, add a tiny splash of milk). Set aside to soak for 1 minute. Add remaining Meatball ingredients EXCEPT the oil. Mix well, and then make 25 – 30 meatballs about the size of a finger pinched to thumb.

2. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meatballs and brown all over (but raw inside still) – about 3 minutes. Remove onto plate, then brown the remaining batch. If there is lots of oil, pour off excess and discard. Lower heat to medium.

3. Add the butter into the skillet and melt, then add flour and stir in, cooking for 1 minute. Add about 1/4 of the beef broth – it will thicken quickly. Then gradually add remaining beef broth, stirring as you go. When the liquid is simmering, add back the meatballs and juices, and cook for 8 – 10 minutes or until the liquid thickens into a thin gravy, stirring occasionally. Add cream, simmer for a further 2 minutes then serve.

When they are done, place them in the sauce, sprinkle with the mozzarella, and bake for 25 mins on 160 degrees fan. Once done, serve with the pasta, sprinkled with chives.

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees fan

3. While frying, mix the topping ingredients in a small bowl.

4. Add the tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, and bayleaves, stir for one minute, and then add the wine and simmer for 1 minute until reduced by half while stirring to deglaze the pan. Put the beans, stock, salt, pepper, and bacon in, stir, and then place the cherry tomatoes and sausages into the mixture. Sprinkle over the topping, avoiding the sausages and tomatoes so they can brown.

5. Bring to a simmer, then place in the oven, uncovered, for 30 mins. If the topping is still not browned then use the grill to brown it.

6. Serve with mash, rice, or pasta.
