#### DIRECTIONS

**CURRY PASTE**

- Place the dry curry paste ingredients in a micro blender and whizz until fine, then add the water and tamarind and whizz to a pulp

**CURRY**

- **Sizzle black mustard seeds:** Heat oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add black mustard seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds - careful, they might pop!

- **Saute onion:** Add red onion and cook for 3 minutes until edges start to tinge with gold.

- **Cook off curry paste:** Add curry paste and cook for 3 minutes - to evaporate water, make spices bloom and cook garlic & ginger.

- **Cook off tomato:** Turn heat up to medium high. Add tomato paste and tomato pulp, cook for 2 minutes.

- **Coconut milk:** Add water, coconut milk, sugar, salt and chilli powder if using. Stir, then bring to simmer, low heat so it's bubbling gently.

- **Simmer 2 minutes, add tomato & green chilli:** Simmer for 2 minutes, add tomato and green chilli.

- **Simmer 3 minutes:** Simmer for another 3 minutes, stirring every now and then - sauce should be thickened (not watery), it gets looser again when fish is added (because fish will drop some juices = even more flavour!).

- **Add fish:** Add fish, stir, cook for 3 to 4 minutes until fish easily flakes.

- **Garnish & serve:** Remove from stove and transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with coriander/cilantro and fresh green chillies if desired. Serve with [basmati rice](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cook-basmati-rice/)!
