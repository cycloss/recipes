![](Images/2022-07-12-09-44-30-image.png)

##### Serves 4 - 30 mins

##### Ingredients

- 1250ml stock (3 cube vegetable and 2 cube fish)
- 400ml dry white wine
- 2 tbsp sunflower oil
- 1 fennel bulb, trimmed and chopped into small pieces
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 500g risotto rice
- ~150g asparagus, chopped into 5cm lengths
- 300g frozen petits pois
- Juice of half a lemon
- 300g salmon fillet, skinned, chopped into large chunks (will fall apart a bit while cooking)
- 4 generous tbsp full-fat crème fraîche
- 60g Parmesan, grated, plus extra for sprinkling
- Fresh tarragon, stems removed and coarsely chopped (about half of a tesco 20g bag)
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

##### Directions

1. Make stock and pour it into a saucepan with the wine and keep warm over a low heat.

2. Chop the fennel, and add it into a large frying pan with oil over a medium-high heat, frying for about 4 minutes, or until softened, but not browned, stirring often. Chop the garlic and measure the rice. Add the garlic and rice and fry for a minute, stirring constantly, until the grains of rice are coated in the oil.

3. Recruit someone to do this: Add a ladleful of the hot stock mixture to the rice and simmer, stirring continuously. Wait until the stock is almost fully absorbed before adding the next ladleful. This should take 15–20 minutes, or until you are left with about 250ml stock in the saucepan and the rice is nearly cooked.

4. While step 3 is being done, skin and chop the salmon, chop the asparagus, and weigh out the petit pois.

5. When step 3 is done, add the asparagus and cook for 2 mins, adding a generous amount of pepper while cooking. Then add the petits pois, lemon juice, and the remaining stock and keep stirring for 2 mins of minutes. Add the salmon slices, crème fraîche, tarragon and Parmesan. Stir, test for seasoning, and continue to cook until the salmon is done to your liking, then serve.

##### Serves 3 (as main) - 45 mins

##### Ingredients

**Frying Ingredients**

- 1 large / 2 small aubergines, cut into 1.5cm (~450g)
- 1/2 tsp salt for sweating the aubergine
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, diced into 2cm pieces
- 2 medium courgettes, diced into 1.5cm pieces (~200g each)
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 brown onions, chopped coarsely into 1.5cm pieces

**Stewing Ingredients**

- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 2 tsp dried/fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/3 tsp black pepper
- Try leave out next time or use only 1/4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 1 tsp sweet paprika?
- 1/4 tsp oregano?
- For serving consider the following: rustic bread / fried egg / fish / rice

##### Directions

1. Chop and then sweat the aubergine by placing it in a colander and sprinkling with the half tsp of salt. This will soften the flesh, allowing it to cook faster, and absorb less oil)

2. Chop all of the other frying ingredients

3. Heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the courgette and cook until a bit coloured, then add the aubergine and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, trying to get a bit of colour on everything.

4. Add another 1 tbsp of olive oil and cook the peppers with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes.

5. Reduce to a medium heat, add another 1 tbsp olive oil, then add the onion with a pinch of the salt, cooking it for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.

6. Add another tbsp of olive oil and all the stewing ingredients into the large pot and mix. Once the mixture is hot, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for 20 – 25 minutes with the pot lid off, stirring every now and then, until all the vegetables are cooked through and the liquid has reduced. The mixture should be thick enough so you can pile it on a plate (ie. not watery), but still very moist and juicy.

7. Once stewed, taste and add more salt if needed. Stir through basil then serve immediately, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of extra basil on top, if desired

## French Omelette

![Screenshot 2023-09-02 at 20.58.38.jpg](Images/acc4c84b8d9fa621f1635086e94c08e3746dba31.jpg)

#### Serves 1 - 10 mins

- 4 eggs

- Just under 1/4 tsp salt

- Butter

- Optional: fillings (go easy on the cheese), chopped chives

#### Directions

1. Crack the eggs, add the salt, and then beat them well until completely homogenised with no whites.

2. Put a non-stick pan on medium-low heat with a good nob of butter. Once the butter is just about completely melted (it should not be bubbling) add the egg and start scraping the bottom quickly around and around with a silicone spatula.

3. The idea is to make a runny scrambled egg first. The curds should not form too quickly; if they are forming too quickly, reduce the heat / take the pan off of the heat. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3EwVIpzFjI&t=212s) for technique. Once the egg is at a custardy consistency, reduce the heat to low, tip most of it towards the far edge of the pan, and spread out the rest in a thin layer over the rest of the pan. Add the fillings where most of the egg is at the edge of the pan, and then gently start to roll the thin layer towards that edge.

4. Once rolled all the way to the edge, tip onto a plate, grind over pepper, add the chopped chives and serve.

## Spanish Omelette

#### Serves 3 - 30 mins

- 700g peeled potatoes, cut in half, and cut into 0.5cm thick slices
- 1 onion, quartered and sliced
- 1/2 cup / 125 ml olive oil
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup of peas
- 8 eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Pepper
- To serve: garlic mayo

#### Directions

1. Heat oil in a non stick fry pan over medium heat. Add the onion, potatoes, and 1/4 tsp of salt, then place a lid on and stew the potatoes gently for 15 minutes or so, turning the potatoes 3 or 4 times until soft and cooked through.

2. Meanwhile, whisk eggs then season with salt and pepper.

3. When potatoes are ready, pour in the peas to defrost them, then pour away most of the oil in the skillet using a plate/lid to hold back the mixture, leaving behind about 1 1/2 - 2 tbsp of oil.

4. Return the mixture to the skillet, then pour over the egg. Cook for 5 minutes or until the underside is light golden.

5. Put the pan under the grill/broiler (not too hot as it's non stick) for a couple of minutes until the centre is just set, and then invert onto a plate and serve.

**Finish**

- Optional: spinach
- 8 eggs
- Coriander, roughly chopped
- Crusty bread / pasta to serve
- Optional: cheese

#### Directions

1. Heat oil in a large pan with a lid over medium high heat (keep the lid off for now). Add garlic and onion, fry for 2 minutes until onion is translucent, then add the pepper, fry for 1 minute. Prepare the stock while frying.

2. Add the simmer ingredients, mix to combine well, then lower stove to medium low and simmer for 5 minutes until just thickened enough to make indentations (don't want dry sludge, needs to still be saucy).

3. Make indentations in the mixture and carefully crack the eggs in. Put the lid on the pan and leave to cook for for a few minutes (~3) until almost set (they will likely continue cooking).

4. Scattered with the coriander, and serve with crusty bread or pasta.
