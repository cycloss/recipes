#### Serves 2 - 1 hr

- Knob of butter

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 6 chicken leg portions, bone-in and skin-on

- onion, diced

#### Directions

Melt the butter and oil in a very large frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the butter is bubbling, lay the chicken portions into the pan to brown, skin-side down. Aim for a deep golden brown all over - this should take about 8 minutes. When the legs are brown, transfer them onto a plate.

Scrape the chopped onion and bacon slices into the pan and fry over a medium to high heat for about 4 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften. Add the garlic and mushrooms along with a good pinch of salt and pepper and continue stir-frying for a further 2 minutes.

Lay the chicken pieces back into the pan, skin-side down, and pour in the chicken stock. Crank up the heat and bring the liquid to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Place a lid on top and leave the chicken to cook for 25 minutes.

After 20 minutes, carefully remove the lid and scatter the green beans over the top, then place the lid back on and cook for a further 5 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked.

Stir in the crème fraiche and bring the sauce to the boil one last time. Scatter with the chopped chives and serve.

## Chicken Pie

![](Images/2022-02-01-10-38-58-image.png)

#### Serves 4

- 2 large knobs of butter

- 1 large leek, washed and chopped into 2cm pieces

- 200g mushrooms, roughly chopped

- 4 x 250g chicken breast fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces

- 250ml chicken stock (1 cube)

- 1 tbsp cornflour

- 100ml double cream

- 2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves

- About 6 sheets of filo pastry

- Drizzle of olive oil

- Peas, salad, and/or mash to serve
1. Preheat your oven to 190°C (fan 170°C). Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the leek and mushrooms and fry for 2–3 minutes until they just start to soften. Crank up the heat to high, add the chicken pieces and fry for a further 2 minutes – the chicken won’t be cooked through at this point – then pour in the chicken stock and let it come to a simmer.

2. Meanwhile, mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water until smooth, then pour into the pan, along with the cream. Bring back to the boil, stirring gently, and cook until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach, then tip the whole lot into a pie dish about 28cm x 15cm. Set aside to cool a little.

3. Take a sheet of filo and roughly crumple it in your hands – there is no right or wrong to this method! Place the crumpled filo on top of the chicken filling in the pie dish and repeat with the remaining filo sheets.

4. Drizzle the pastry with olive oil, then bake the pie for about 20 minutes, by which time the filo will have crisped up and turned golden brown in places. Serve up your pie with fresh salad or some vegetables.

## Creamy Dijon Chicken

![](Images/2022-05-20-10-00-56-image.png)

#### Serves 4 - 45 mins

**The Chicken**

- ~500g boneless, skinless chicken thigh or breast cut into slices about the size of one mouthful
- Salt & Pepper
- 150g bacon (diced)

**The Sauce**

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley (optional)
- 1 teaspoon each of thyme and rosemary (be generous)
- 100ml dry white wine (Pinot Grigio/Gris, Sauv Blanc, Riesling)
- 350ml double cream
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 100g grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 good handfuls of baby spinach leaves

**To Serve**

- Greens

- Mash

#### Directions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over high heat, add the chicken, season it with a pinch of salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper, and cook until browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer to a plate; set aside.

2. To the same pan or skillet, reduce heat to medium-high (prevents fond from burning), and add the bacon, frying until crispy. Transfer to plate, set aside. At this point there should be a good layer of brown fond on the bottom of the pan.

3. Reduce heat to medium. Heat butter in the pan and sauté onion until transparent. Sauté garlic, thyme, and rosemary for about 1 minute until fragrant.

4. Add in the white wine to deglaze the pan while scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan. Also add the stock cube. Simmer for ~2 minutes or until wine has reduced by half.

5. Reduce heat to medium low, important as the cream will split if boiled. Pour in the Dijon mustard first to cool down the mixture, then add the cream, and mix through heating gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken.

6. Add the Parmesan and half of the bacon (all if you can't be bothered with it as a topping), and allow to melt through the sauce. Season with a generous amount of pepper.

7. Add the spinach and allow to wilt. Return chicken to the skillet and reheat. Add some water if too thick.

8. Top with the crispy bacon if you didn't add all of it already. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.

## Shepherds / Cottage Pie

![](Images/2022-08-31-10-33-31-image.png)

#### Serves 5 - 1.5 hrs

**Mince**

- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1 celery stick, finely chopped
- 3/4 tsp each dried thyme and rosemary (or 2 sprigs fresh thyme + 1 sprig rosemary)
- 750g minced lamb (shepherds) OR beef (cottage)
- 1/4 cup (35g) flour , plain/all purpose
- 1/4 cup (55g) tomato paste
- 2 cups (500ml) beef stock (**3** cubes)
- 1/2 cup (125ml) red wine (or water)
- 1.5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- Salt, pepper, and sriracha (optional)
- 1 cup frozen peas

**Mash**

- 1 kg potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 2/3 cup (165 ml) milk (whole or low fat)
- 2 tbsp (30g) butter

**Crust**

- 2 – 3 tbsp grated parmesan , optional
- Chopped chives to garnish

#### Directions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots, celery, thyme and rosemary. Cook for 3 minutes or until softened and sweet.
2. Turn heat up to high. Add lamb/beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until browned.
3. Add flour and mix in. Add tomato paste, stock, red wine, Worcestershire sauce and bay leaves. Bring to simmer, then turn down heat so it is simmering rapidly - I have it on medium. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces down to a thick gravy consistency.
4. Once the mince is simmering, put water on to boil, chop the potatoes. When the water is boiling preheat oven to 180C/350F and and then cook the potatoes in boiling water for 15-20 minutes or until soft. Drain then return to pot on turned off stove. Allow to steam dry for 30 seconds or so (prevents it making the mince watery). Add butter, milk, and salt, and mash until a spreadable consistency.
5. When mince has finished simmering, adjust salt and pepper to taste (add a small amount of sriracha for an almost undetectable hum), then transfer to 1.5 litre baking dish (could try doing it in the pan the mince is currently in if it is large). Stir through peas.
6. Spread mash onto pie, use a fork to draw squiggles over the surface. Sprinkle with parmesan.
7. Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until deep golden on top and bubbling on the edges. Stick a knife into the middle to ensure it is piping hot. Garnished with chives if desired and serve.

2. Meanwhile, add the flour and salt into a mixing bowl, make a hole in the middle and slowly add the eggs with a bit of the milk and water mixture, mixing into a paste. Slowly add the rest of the water and milk mixture, beating well until you have the consistency of double cream.

3. Once the sausages are done, take them out and pour in the batter on top of them, making sure the sausages are evenly spaced, then return to the oven and cook for another 20-30mins until risen and golden brown.

4. While the toad is cooking, add 1 tbsp of vegetable oil to a small saucepan on medium head, then add the onions, put the lid back on and sweat them until softened. Add the onion marmalade and wine, boiling to reduce by half (about 5 mins). Add the water, and slowly add the gravy granules until the desired consistency is reached.

5. Serve when the toad is done with mash and peas.

## Aubergine Dumpling Parmigiana

- 1¼ cups (90 g) dried breadcrumbs
- 4 eggplants (~1 kg), cut into 1-inch cubes
- ½ cup + 2 tbsp (150 ml) olive oil
- salt and black pepper
- 6 tbsp (100 g) ricotta
- 2.5 oz (75 g) grated parmesan cheese, plus more to serve
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 4.5 tsp all purpose flour
- 6 garlic cloves, grated
- ¾ cup (15 g) basil leaves, roughly chopped
- 28 oz cans whole peeled tomatoes, blitzed until smooth
- 1½ tsp tomato paste
- 1½ tsp sugar
- ¼ tsp red pepper flakes
- ¾ tsp paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1⅔ cups (400 ml) water
1. Heat oven to 450F.
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the chopped eggplant to the pan and toss with 5 tbsp olive oil, ½ tsp salt, and black pepper to taste. Spread out into as even a layer as possible and place in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, tossing halfway through.
3. Remove the eggplants from the oven and chop until they break down and form a chunky mash. Scoop into a large bowl and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes or until cooled to at least room temperature.
4. Once cool, add the ricotta, parmesan, egg, egg yolk, flour, breadcrumbs, a third of the garlic, ½ cup of the basil, ¼ tsp salt, and black pepper to the bowl. Mix well. Season to taste with more salt, if needed.
5. Grease your hands and then scoop the eggplant mixture into sixteen golf-ball sized dumplings.
6. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the dumplings to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes or until golden and crispy all over. Transfer to a plate. Add another tbsp of oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining dumplings. Set aside.
7. Heat oven to 400F.
8. To make the sauce, put the remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil into a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining garlic to the pan and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add in the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, chile flakes, paprika, oregano, 1 tsp salt, and black pepper. Cook for 8 minutes, or until thickened. Pour in the water. Bring to a simmer, then lower to medium and simmer for 10 more minutes.
9. Pour the sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Top with the dumplings, nestling them into the sauce as needed. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with basil and more parmesan cheese just before serving.
