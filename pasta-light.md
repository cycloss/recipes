Heat the oil in a medium saucepan, then add the garlic, chilli and basil and cook these briefly till the garlic is pale gold. Then add all the other sauce ingredients, stir and season with pepper. Turn the heat to low and let the sauce simmer very gently without a lid for 40 minutes, by which time it will have reduced.

When there is 15 mins left for the sauce, put the spaghetti on. When ready, serve with Basil garnish if you want to be fancy, and grated Parmesan to sprinkle over.

#### Serves 3 - 1 hr

- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)
- 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)
- 2 beef stock cubes
- 2 cans tinned tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)
- Salt and pepper

#### TO SERVE

- 400 g / 13 oz spaghetti , dried
- Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional)

#### Directions

- Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.

- Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.

- Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.

- Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.

## LINGUINE WITH CHILLI, CRAB AND WATERCRESS

![](Images/2022-01-27-09-23-20-image.png)

**Serves 4**

- 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 scant tablespoon maldon salt
- 1 large red chilli
- 200 grams white crab meat (do not use canned)
- 100 grams brown crab meat (do not use canned)
- 125 millilitres extra virgin olive oil
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 2 packs fresh, or 500g grams dry linguine
- 1 handful watercress (roughly torn)

Put a large pan of water on to boil for the pasta.

In a large pestle and mortar pulverise the peeled garlic cloves with the salt, so that it makes a smooth paste. Then add the chopped and seeded chilli and crush again until you have a gloriously red-tinged mixture. Tip in the crab meat, breaking it up gently with a fork, and pour in the oil. Zest the lemon into the mortar and then add the juice. Mix.

Cook the pasta, reserving some of the water. Pour over the crab sauce, parmesan, and toss the pasta about in it, adding some pasta water if needs be, then throw in the watercress and toss again.

## Carbonara

![](Images/carbonara.jpeg)

**Serves 3**

- 175g guanciale or pancetta or 300g of streaky bacon in order or preference
- 3 garlic cloves, minced / 1 tsp garlic paste
- 2 large eggs and 2 egg yolks
- 100g pecorino
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 400g spaghetti

**Method**

1. Place the eggs and yolks in a large bowl and whisk to combine, then grate and stir in the cheese and pepper.

2. Put 3 litres of water on to boil and chop the guanciale.

3. Place guanciale in a cool non stick pan and bring up to medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. If using bacon, add a touch of oil. Turn off the heat and add the garlic, stirring to combine.

4. While the guanciale is frying, put on the pasta, and once done, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta, letting it sit for 30 secs so it's not too hot. Add some of the pasta water to the sauce mix to temper it (makes it less likely to curdle)

5. Tip the pasta into the pan and mix to coat in the guanciale / garlic fat. Quickly transfer the pasta to the large bowl with the sauce mix, along with 1/2 a cup of the pasta water (do not transfer the mix to the pan as it will likely be too hot and scramble). Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy. Add more pasta water if required and check for seasoning.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano, some pepper, and finely chopped parsley.

Take off the heat.

- Put the pasta water on to boil

- In the chicken bacon juices of the pan on medium heat, add the remaining butter, and fry the garlic for 30 seconds, then add the wine until mostly evaporated, stirring to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan.

## Ratatouille

![](Images/2022-07-26-21-16-22-image.png)

##### Serves 3 (as main) - 45 mins

##### Ingredients

**Frying Ingredients**

- 1 aubergine, cut into 1.5cm (~450g)
- 1/2 tsp salt for sweating the aubergine
- 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, diced into 2cm pieces
- 2 medium courgettes, diced into 1.5cm pieces (~200g each)
- 4 garlic cloves (~3 tsp), finely chopped (not minced as will burn)
- 2 brown onions, chopped coarsely into 1.5cm pieces

**Stewing Ingredients**

- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 20 black olives, pitted, halved (about 4 tbsp of pre sliced)
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves, chopped (more if can't taste, be generous)
- 1 tsp salt, cooking/kosher salt
- black pepper
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 1 tsp sweet paprika?
- 1/4 tsp oregano?
- For serving consider the following: rustic bread / fried egg / fish

##### Directions

1. Chop and then sweat the aubergine by placing it in a colander and sprinkling with the half tsp of salt. This will soften the flesh, allowing it to cook faster, and absorb less oil)

2. Chop all of the other frying ingredients

3. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat (8). Add the aubergine and courgette, and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, trying to get a bit of colour on the vegetables. Transfer to a large pot (**important** as otherwise won't stew properly).

4. Add another 1 tbsp of olive oil and cook the peppers with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes. Add to pot.

5. Reduce to a medium heat, add another 1 tbsp olive oil, then add the onion with a pinch of the salt, cooking it for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.

6. Add all the stewing ingredients into the large pot and mix. Once the mixture is hot, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for 20 – 25 minutes with the pot lid off, stirring every now and then, until all the vegetables are cooked through and the liquid has reduced. The mixture should be thick enough so you can pile it on a plate (ie. not watery), but still very moist and juicy.

7. Once stewed, taste and add more salt if needed. Stir through basil then serve immediately, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of extra basil on top, if desired

## French Omelette

![Screenshot 2023-09-02 at 20.58.38.jpg](Images/acc4c84b8d9fa621f1635086e94c08e3746dba31.jpg)

#### Serves 1 - 10 mins

- 4 eggs

- Just under 1/4 tsp salt

- Butter

- Optional: fillings (go easy on the cheese), chopped chives

#### Directions

1. Crack the eggs, add the salt, and then beat them well until completely homogenised with no whites.

2. Put a non-stick pan on medium-low heat with a good nob of butter. Once the butter is just about completely melted (it should not be bubbling) add the egg and start scraping the bottom quickly around and around with a silicone spatula.

3. The idea is to make a runny scrambled egg first. The curds should not form too quickly; if they are forming too quickly, reduce the heat / take the pan off of the heat. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3EwVIpzFjI&t=212s) for technique. Once the egg is at a custardy consistency, reduce the heat to low, tip most of it towards the far edge of the pan, and spread out the rest in a thin layer over the rest of the pan. Add the fillings where most of the egg is at the edge of the pan, and then gently start to roll the thin layer towards that edge.

4. Once rolled all the way to the edge, tip onto a plate, grind over pepper, add the chopped chives and serve.

- 300g oyster mushrooms, roughly chopped
- 40g dried porcini
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 3–4 plum tomatoes, chopped into large chunks (350g)
- 120ml olive oil
- 70g white miso paste
- 40g rose harissa (adjust according to the brand you are using)
- 4 tbsp tomato paste
- 90ml soy sauce

- 100ml red wine
- salt and black pepper
- Fresh tagliatelle pasta

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.

2. Put the first six ingredients into a food processor and pulse until everything is very finely chopped (similar in size to bits of mince).

3. Put the chopped vegetables into a large, 36cm x 28cm (it's very important that it's this size of larger as it allows proper browning) high-sided baking tray with the oil, miso, harissa, tomato paste, soy sauce and cumin seeds and mix very well. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through, until browned around the edges and bubbling.

4. Reduce the heat to 180°C fan.

5. Add all the remaining ingredients to the tray, along with 150ml of water, ⅓ teaspoon of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper. Stir very well, scraping the crispy sides and bottom with a spatula. Cover tightly with foil and bake for another 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for a final 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed a little before serving. While resting, cook the fresh pasta.
