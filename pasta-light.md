![](Images/frittata.jpeg)

Time: 30mins, Serves 3

- 6 small potatoes, (3 medium)

- 1 large onion, (2 small) diced

- 75g frozen peas

- 10 large eggs, (16 bantam)

- salt and pepper

- 4 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan

- 3 tablespoons olive oil

- Assorted toppings (ham, blue cheese)

Bring the diced potatoes to the boil in salted water and boil briskly for 5 minutes, then drain, using the water to boil the peas.

Fry the onion until it begins to soften, then add the potatoes and cook for about 10 minutes.

Add the drained peas for the last couple of minutes of cooking. Break the eggs into the bowl, and beat to mix. Season with salt and pepper and add the parmesan. Pour egg mixture into the frying pan; it should still be nice and oily.

Add any other toppings lying around like ham and blue cheese

Then cook over a medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until the frittata is set more or less, save for a still-gooey top.

Then grill on medium until the top is brown

- Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.

- Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.

![](Images/2022-01-27-09-23-20-image.png)

**Serves 4**

- 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped

- 2 packs fresh, or 500g grams dry linguine
- 1 handful watercress (roughly torn)

Put a large pan of water on to boil for the pasta.

In a large pestle and mortar pulverise the peeled garlic cloves with the salt, so that it makes a smooth paste. Then add the chopped and seeded chilli and crush again until you have a gloriously red-tinged mixture. Tip in the crab meat, breaking it up gently with a fork, and pour in the oil. Zest the lemon into the mortar and then add the juice. Mix.

Cook the pasta, reserving some of the water. Pour over the crab sauce, parmesan, and toss the pasta about in it, adding some pasta water if needs be, then throw in the watercress and toss again.

## Ratatouille

![](Images/2022-07-26-21-16-22-image.png)

##### Ingredients

**Frying Ingredients**

- 1 aubergine, cut into 1.5cm (~450g)
- 1/2 tsp salt for sweating the aubergine
- 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, diced into 2cm pieces
- 2 medium courgettes, diced into 1.5cm pieces (~200g each)
- 4 garlic cloves (~3 tsp), finely chopped (not minced as will burn)
- 2 brown onions, chopped coarsely into 1.5cm pieces

**Stewing Ingredients**

- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 20 black olives, pitted, halved (about 4 tbsp of pre sliced)
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves, chopped (more if can't taste, be generous)
- 1 tsp salt, cooking/kosher salt
- black pepper
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 1 tsp sweet paprika?
- 1/4 tsp oregano?
- For serving consider the following: rustic bread / fried egg / fish

##### Directions

1. Chop and then sweat the aubergine by placing it in a colander and sprinkling with the half tsp of salt. This will soften the flesh, allowing it to cook faster, and absorb less oil)

2. Chop all of the other frying ingredients

3. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat (8). Add the aubergine and courgette, and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, trying to get a bit of colour on the vegetables. Transfer to a large pot (**important** as otherwise won't stew properly).

4. Add another 1 tbsp of olive oil and cook the peppers with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes. Add to pot.

5. Reduce to a medium heat, add another 1 tbsp olive oil, then add the onion with a pinch of the salt, cooking it for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.

6. Add all the stewing ingredients into the large pot and mix. Once the mixture is hot, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for 20 – 25 minutes with the pot lid off, stirring every now and then, until all the vegetables are cooked through and the liquid has reduced. The mixture should be thick enough so you can pile it on a plate (ie. not watery), but still very moist and juicy.

7. Once stewed, taste and add more salt if needed. Stir through basil then serve immediately, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of extra basil on top, if desired
