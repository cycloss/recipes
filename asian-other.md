- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 can tinned tomatoes

**To Serve**

#### Directions

1. **Make the paste** Place the dry curry paste ingredients in a micro blender and whizz until fine, then add the water and tamarind and whizz to a pulp.

2. **Sizzle black mustard seeds:** Heat oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add black mustard seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds - careful, they might pop!

3. **Saute onion:** Add red onion and cook for 3 minutes until edges start to tinge with gold.

4. **Cook off curry paste:** Add curry paste and cook for 3 minutes - to evaporate water, make spices bloom and cook garlic & ginger.

5. **Cook off tomato:** Turn heat up to medium high. Add tomato paste and tomato pulp, cook for 2 minutes.

6. **Coconut milk:** Add water, coconut milk, sugar, salt and chilli powder if using. Stir, then bring to simmer, low heat so it's bubbling gently.

7. **Simmer 2 minutes, add tomato & green chilli:** Simmer for 2 minutes, add tomato and green chilli.

8. **Simmer 3 minutes:** Simmer for another 3 minutes, stirring every now and then - sauce should be thickened (not watery), it gets looser again when fish is added (because fish will drop some juices = even more flavour!).

9. **Add fish:** Add fish, stir, cook for 3 to 4 minutes until fish easily flakes.

10. **Garnish & serve:** Remove from stove and transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with coriander/cilantro and fresh green chillies if desired. Serve with [basmati rice](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cook-basmati-rice/)!

**Spices**

- 1 tbsp ground cumin

- 1 tbsp ground coriander

- 3/4 tsp ground turmeric

- 1/2 tsp mild chilli powder - trial 1 tsp?

- 1 bay leaf

- 4 cloves, round bits on the end pinched off with fingers and crushed, long bits discarded

**Simmer**

- 1 tbsp plain ﬂour

- 50g finely chopped almonds

- 300ml water

- small pinch of saﬀron

- 1 tbsp light brown sugar

- 1/2 tsp ﬁne sea salt - trial 3/4 tsp?

**Chicken**

- 1 tbsp oil

- 600g chicken (breast or thigh), chopped into bite sized pieces

- 2 tbsp plain yoghurt (greek or natural)

**Finish**

- 60ml double cream

- fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to garnish (optional)

- Rice to serve.

#### Directions

1. Dice the onions, put a medium sized pan on medium low, add the oil, and fry the onions with a bit of salt covered for 5 minutes until softening, stirring every few minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another 5 minutes covered.

2. Prepare all the spices, then when the onion mixture is done, add them and cook for 5 minutes uncovered. Add the plain flower and chopped almonds and cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add the water, stirring constantly to dissolve the fond on the bottom of the pan, and add the saffron, sugar, and salt. Simmer covered for 10 minutes.

3. While the sauce simmers, put the rice on, and then chop the chicken.

4. When the sauce is done, remove the bay leaf and transfer it to a bowl / jug suitable for a stick blender (I use the jug I measure the water with), scraping the pan as clean as you can with a spatula. Put the pan back on the burner on medium high heat with oil, add the chicken when hot, and spoon on and mix in the yoghurt. Cook the chicken until almost cooked through with a little color if you can, but it's not necessary.

5. While the chicken cooks, use a stick blender to blend the sauce until a grainy consistency.

6. When the chicken is cooked, reduce the heat to medium low, wait for the pan to reach that temperature, then add the blended sauce back. Simmer covered for 10 minutes. While simmering, chop the coriander. Once simmered, add the cream and stir through for a minute or so, then serve with rice and the coriander.
