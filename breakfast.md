#### Directions

1. Put the fish fingers on, when done put them together and lay the cheese slice on top leaving them to cool.

## Custardy Scrambled Egg

#### Serves 1 - 15 mins

- 3 medium eggs

- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

- Pinch of Pepper

- 2 chive leaves + 1 to garnish

- A good knob of butter

- To serve: toast and shredded smoked salmon

#### Directions

1. Put a pan on with the butter at low/medium heat, about a 4

2. Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper, and chop the chives finely with scissors into the egg mix (fold the chive leaves into a small parcel to make them quicker to chop)

3. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. If the pan is too hot, the egg will immediately solidify on contact. This is absolutely not desired, and ruins the dish. It should start to semi solidify slowly after 10-20 seconds. Repeat the following three steps until the egg has a custardy consistency. It should take about 5-10 minutes. Any faster and the egg will have been cooked too hard:
   
   1. Once there is a thin layer of semi-solid egg on the bottom of the pan, make long, slow strokes across the bottom of the pan with a flat ended wooden spoon. If the egg has solidified fully to the point where it is dry when pulling it off the bottom, the pan was too hot, or the egg was left too long, and the dish is probably ruined.
   
   2. After each pass, tap the egg curds of off the spoon, breaking them up if they are too big.
   
   3. With the spoon, spread the egg back out evenly across the pan and go back to step 1.
