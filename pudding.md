#### Serves 10 - 1 hr

**Biscuit Base**

- 300 g digestives
- 150 g unsalted butter

**Cheesecake Filling**

- 250 g white chocolate
- 500 g full fat cream cheese
- 100 g icing sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 300 ml double cream
- 250 g fresh raspberries

**Decoration**

- 2 tbsp icing sugar
- 100 g white chocolate
- 200g fresh raspberries

#### Directions

**For the Biscuit Base**

- Blitz the biscuits in a food processor to a small crumb, and add the melted butter – then pulse in the food processor a few times until the mixture is combined.

- Tip the biscuit mixture into a 8″/20cm deep springform tin and press down firmly (I use a flat potato masher with small holes).

#### For the Cheesecake Filling

- Melt the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave on short bursts until full melted (use the defrost setting) – leave to cool whilst doing the rest.

- Clean the food processor, and change it to use the dough hook instead of a blade. Add in the cream cheese, icing sugar and vanilla, and process until smooth. Pour in the double cream and process on low in 5-10 second bursts until thick! Test with a teaspoon that it doesn't easily run off it.

- Once completed, pour in the cooled white chocolate, and pulse briefly to combine, and then fold through the fresh raspberries (do not pulse or the mixture will turn pink).

- Spread the mix over the biscuit base, smooth over, then drizzle over the melted white chocolate, add the fresh raspberries in concentric circles, then dust with icing sugar. (I don't do the whipped cream).

- Chill in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably overnight so it will definitely be set.
