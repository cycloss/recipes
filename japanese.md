## Salmon Teriyaki Noodles

![](Images/2022-07-10-11-16-29-image.png)

#### Serves 2 - 20 mins

**Teriyaki Sauce**

- 2 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 2 tbsp cooking sake, or Chinese cooking wine
- 1 tsp white sugar

**Other**

- 1 tbsp oil (veg or canola)
- 250g salmon fillet(s), skinless, sliced into 2cm wide pieces down their length
- 2 instant noodle / ramen noodle cakes (discard seasoning packs) (Note 2 other noodles)
- 1 onion , cut into quarters and sliced
- 2 garlic clove , finely minced
- 1 small bunch Chinese of stem greens like tenderstem broccoli cut in half lengthways

#### Directions

- Mix the Teriyaki sauce and coat salmon with 1 tablespoon of it in a bowl, then set aside while you cook the noodles.

- Cook the noodles as per the packet directions but without the seasoning sachet, then set aside.

- Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large **non-stick** pan over high heat. Cook the salmon for 1 - 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden, then remove to a plate. Pour any remaining sauce in the skillet over the salmon.

- Heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil on medium and cook the onion and garlic for 30 seconds. Add the stem greens and cook for 1 minute.

#### Serves 2 - 30 mins

- 1 pack unsmoked streaky bacon, sliced into 2cm strips

- 1 cabbage (savoy / hakusai), halved, core removed, chopped lengthways, and then chopped across into squares. Make sure all the chunks are broken up.

- 1 bunch of spring onions, green part cut into 4cm segments, white part finely sliced

- 2 tsp (4 cloves) garlic, minced

- 1 tsp ginger paste

- 1 tsp chilli paste

- 2 tbsp cooking sake

- 400g straight to wok noodles

**Sauce**

- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce

- 1 tbsp oyster sauce

- 1 tbsp ketchup

- 1 tbsp sake

- 1 tbsp lea and perins

- 1 tsp sugar

#### Directions

1. Slice the bacon and put it in a cold non-stick pan on medium high heat, grind a good amount of pepper all over it.

2. While the bacon is frying, chop the cabbage and spring onions, and put the garlic, ginger paste, and chilli paste into a small dish.

3. Once the bacon has good colour (not full crispy though), still on medium high add the cabbage, spring onion, and the paste mix and fry for a few mins until the cabbage wilts a bit, mixing regularly. While waiting, mix everything in the sauce into a small bowl. Once the veg has wilted a bit, add the sake and mix in for 20 secs to burn off the alcohol, then put everything aside onto a plate.

4. Put the pan back on the heat (still medium high) with 1-2 tbsp of oil, and add the noodles, swirling them around to coat in oil. Keep frying on one side until they go partially golden brown (this is key), then flip them and fry the other side. Once fried, separate the noodles, add the bacon and veg mixture back, mix together, then add the sauce mixture, stirring for 30 secs to reduce it a bit. Serve.

## Omurice

![Screenshot 2024-01-31 at 16.00.53.jpg](Images/309eb8db2ca7864cd4285675505e7471261824bf.jpg)

#### Serves 2 - 30 mins

- 1 cup of Japanese rice

- 3 good knobs of butter

- 1 small brown onion, diced

- 200g cooked chicken breast, chopped into small pieces

- Optional: 1/2 tsp tube garlic

**Sauce**

- 100ml water

- 1 tsp sugar

- 1 chicken stock cube

- 2 tbsp ketchup

- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (?)

- 1 tsp soy sauce (?)

**Finishing**

- Black pepper

- 1 cup of frozen peas

- 2 x 1/5 tsp salt

- 6 eggs

- Broccoli / salad to serve

#### Directions

1. Put on the rice to cook

2. Heat a knob of butter on medium heat in a non stick frying pan, then add the onion and fry until translucent. While the onion is frying, add all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.

3. Add the chopped chicken and garlic, fry for a minute, then add the sauce ingredients. Boil off most of the water to leave a thick mixture, then add the peas and a good amount of black pepper.

4. While the rice is finishing, whisk together 3 eggs and 1/5 tsp salt for the first omelette.

5. When the rice is done, add it to the frying pan and fold through until coated with the mixture. Pour it out on a plate and set it aside.

6. Put the broccoli on

7. Rinse the frying pan, and follow the instructions to make an omelette from the `lasta-light.md` file (make scrambled egg first etc). When the scrambled egg mixture is custardy has mostly been moved to the far third of the pan, put half of the rice mixture on that far third in a roughly almond shape. Then when the omelette starts to set, fold the near side up on top of the rice with a spatula, then tilt the pan away from you and keep rolling and shuffling everything towards the far edge of the pan with a spatula, tucking in the corners to make the almond shape. When it's been rolled so that it's resting on the far edge of the pan and the pan is at a high angle of tilt, make sure with the spatula that it is ready to release, and then flip it onto a plate, hoping it will keep its shape!

8. Repeat with the rest of the egg and rice, and serve with broccoli / salad
