Heat the oil in a medium saucepan, then add the garlic, chilli and basil and cook these briefly till the garlic is pale gold. Then add all the other sauce ingredients, stir and season with pepper. Turn the heat to low and let the sauce simmer very gently without a lid for 40 minutes, by which time it will have reduced.

#### Serves 3 - 1 hr

- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)
- 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)
- 125ml (1/2 cup) of red wine
- 2 beef stock cubes
- 2 cans tinned tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 3/4 tsp salt
- Good grind of pepper

#### TO SERVE

- 400 g / 13 oz spaghetti , dried
- Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional)

#### Directions

- Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.

- Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.

- Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.

- Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.

## LINGUINE WITH CHILLI, CRAB AND WATERCRESS

![](Images/2022-01-27-09-23-20-image.png)

**Serves 4**

- 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 scant tablespoon maldon salt
- 1 large red chilli
- 200 grams white crab meat (do not use canned)
- 100 grams brown crab meat (do not use canned)
- 125 millilitres extra virgin olive oil
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 2 packs fresh, or 500g grams dry linguine
- 1 handful watercress (roughly torn)

Put a large pan of water on to boil for the pasta.

In a large pestle and mortar pulverise the peeled garlic cloves with the salt, so that it makes a smooth paste. Then add the chopped and seeded chilli and crush again until you have a gloriously red-tinged mixture. Tip in the crab meat, breaking it up gently with a fork, and pour in the oil. Zest the lemon into the mortar and then add the juice. Mix.

Cook the pasta, reserving some of the water. Pour over the crab sauce, parmesan, and toss the pasta about in it, adding some pasta water if needs be, then throw in the watercress and toss again.

## Carbonara

![](Images/carbonara.jpeg)

**Serves 3**

- 300g of streaky bacon, or 175g of guanciale or pancetta if you have it
- 3 garlic cloves, minced / 1 tsp garlic paste
- 2 large eggs and 2 egg yolks
- 100g pecorino
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 400g spaghetti

**Method**

1. Place the eggs and yolks in a large bowl and whisk to combine, then grate and stir in the cheese and pepper.

2. Put 3 litres of water on to boil and chop the guanciale.

3. Place guanciale in a cool non stick pan and bring up to medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. If using bacon, add a touch of oil. Turn off the heat and add the garlic, stirring to combine.

4. While the guanciale is frying, put on the pasta, and once done, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta, letting it sit for 30 secs so it's not too hot. Add some of the pasta water to the sauce mix to temper it (makes it less likely to curdle)

5. Tip the pasta into the pan and mix to coat in the guanciale / garlic fat. Quickly transfer the pasta to the large bowl with the sauce mix, along with 1/2 a cup of the pasta water (do not transfer the mix to the pan as it will likely be too hot and scramble). Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy. Add more pasta water if required and check for seasoning.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano, some pepper, and finely chopped parsley.

While chicken is cooking, chop the bacon, then when the chicken is done, put it aside on a plate, cook the bacon until crispy, and put that with the chicken. 

2. While the bacon is cooking, put the pasta water on to boil, chop the garlic and tomatoes, make the stock, and grate the parmesan.

3. Put the pasta on.

4. When the bacon is done, in the chicken bacon juices of the pan on medium heat, add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds, then add the wine until mostly evaporated, stirring to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Then add all of the sauce ingredients apart from the baby spinach and tomato, mix until incorporated, then add the chicken, bacon, baby spinach and tomato.

5. Drain the pasta, keeping a mug full, just in case it needs more lubrication. Add it to the sauce and mix in.

Remove one-third of the chickpeas and set aside to use as a garnish.

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.

2. Put the carrot, onion, and garlic into a food processor and pulse until everything is very finely chopped (similar in size to bits of mince) and tip out into a large, 36cm x 28cm (it's very important that it's this size of larger as it allows proper browning) high-sided baking tray. Then do the same for the oyster mushrooms and dried porcini.

3. Add to the tray the chopped tomatoes, oil, miso, harissa, tomato paste, soy sauce and cumin, and mix very well. Bake for 20 minutes, take out and stir, then bake for another 20 minutes until browned around the edges and bubbling.

4. Reduce the heat to 180°C fan.

5. Add all the remaining ingredients to the tray, along with 150ml of water, 1/3 teaspoon of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper. Stir very well, scraping the crispy sides and bottom with a spatula. Cover tightly with foil and bake for another 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for a final 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed a little before serving. While resting, cook the fresh pasta.

2. Put the water on to boil, and open the can of tomatoes, adding the sugar, salt, oregano, paprika, chilli flakes, and garlic paste to it, so it's ready to pour into the pan.
